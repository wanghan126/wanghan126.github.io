Abstract:
To fully utilize the energy resources, inter-provincial electricity trading have been conducted in multiple Chinese provincial power grids. This paper proposes a two-phase market clearing framework to facilitate inter-provincial electricity trading in Chinese power grids. In Phase one, the pre-processing of bid curves is implemented to address the multi-segment bid behaviors of massive market participants. As the pre-processing methods, network partition, curve aggregation and curve approximation are developed to reduce the computation complexity. In Phase two, a bi-level model is established to depict the market clearing process, which includes the upper-level model for inter-provincial trading and the lower-level model for intra-provincial trading. Those two models are iteratively solved by passing the optimal electricity purchase price and electricity demands to each other. Numerical experiments based on the IEEE systems and the practical Chinese inter-provincial power grids are carried out to verify the validity and scalability of the proposed framework. The simulation results indicate that: 1) the pre-processing of bid curves effectively reduce the computational burdens; 2) the inter-provincial market promotes the utilization of energy resources and increases the total social welfare. Further, the errors caused by the pre-processing methods are analyzed and the availability of the proposed framework is discussed.
