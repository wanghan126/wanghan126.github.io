Abstract:
Reliably diagnosing faults of photovoltaic (PV) arrays is essential for improving the safety and productivity of PV systems, and it relies on large and carefully annotated data, which is difficult to obtain due to outdoor environment limits and technical or human mistakes. Therefore, it is crucial to design a robust method to deal with the label error problem in the training data. To this end, this paper proposes a novel PV array fault diagnosis method based on distributionally robust logistic regression (DRLR). First, online data, including voltage and current sequences at maximum power points, temperature and solar irradiation, are used to establish the input data of PV array fault diagnosis. Second, a data processing method is proposed to extract the fault feature from electrical signals under fluctuant ambient conditions. Third, the parameter estimation of the regression-based fault diagnosis model is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem. To hedge against the label errors, an ambiguity set of probability distributions is established from the training data, and the DRLR method is developed to minimize the expected log-loss function under the worst-case probability distribution. Finally, the proposed method is tested on real-world PV arrays under diverse conditions and scenarios.
