Abstract:
In modern cities, consumers with distributed energy resources (DERs) can trade energy by managing their consumption and supply. Blockchain is considered to provide technical support for establishing a distributed energy market, while the current mainstream blockchain technology cannot meet the requirement of efficiency and scalability under such a transaction scenario. In addition, the potential defaults of market players also hinder market implementation. Therefore, a reputation-based distributed energy trading mechanism and the corresponding blockchain consensus method considering reputation management are proposed in this paper. Firstly, a distributed reputation management mechanism is designed to systematically evaluate the userâ€™s behavior in the market. Secondly, to address the limitations of traditional consensus methods in the distributed energy market distributed reputation control is introduced into the node model of blockchain, and a new energy blockchain consensus method named DPoR is proposed to solve the technical bottleneck under the distributed energy trading scenario. We also present a corresponding transaction mechanism to encourage market participants to maintain their reputations. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed transaction mechanism in this paper, and the presented blockchain consensus mechanism can meet the performance requirements under distributed energy trading scenarios in terms of high efficiency, low consumption, and openness.
